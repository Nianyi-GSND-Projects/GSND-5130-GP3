## Research Question 1

<blockquote>
	Do American people have different phonological preferences when pronouncing names of different cultures?
</blockquote>

### Motivation

Based on real-life experiences of us foreign students, it is often for people in America to pronounce our names in the wrong way.
This is not only true for names originally written with [logographic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system#Logographic_systems) (like Chinese)—which, after being Latinized, might appear exotic to English users—but also applies to alphabetical systems (like Arabic, Hindi or Persian).
Names of those languages which apply an alphabetical writing system are not necessarily exotic to English.
Often times, their spelling match the [phonotactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics) of English perfectly, and so do their pronunciations agree with what their spellings suggested, predicted with usual English [spelling pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_pronunciation).

Naturally, people should just read them in the most direct way, which is also the correct way, but in reality this is not the case.
We tried to explain the reason behind it, and so far the most logical assumption we have is:
When people meet us in person, they could infer our races from our appearances;
and this (assumed) knowledge is what caused their perception on the names' pronunciations to shift, because the languages used by different cultures have some "stereotypical phonetical features" to English users.

### Background

Such "stereotypical phonetical features" is not something new to English.
Take the out-dated ethnic slur "Ching chong" as an example:
According to NPR \[1\], it is a derogatory imitation of Mandarin and Cantonese phonology, due to the high-frequency occurrence of the <u>retroflex fricatives</u> (sounds like [ʂ], [ʐ] and such) and <u>velar nasals</u> (the [ŋ] sound, usually spelled with the digraph &lt;ng&gt; in English).

Similar things have also happened on other languages, but as we're stepping into the current decade, a new form of these imitations are appearing—the language/accent imitating viral videos.
They could be found on almost every video platforms like YouTube \[2\] or TikTok \[3\].

Also, a phenomenon called <u>hypercorrection</u> may happen when one encounters an unfamiliar language environment.
It is the nonstandard use of language that results from the overapplication of a perceived rule of language-usage prescription.
In our case, reading names of exotic cultures might trigger hypercorrection on English users.

### Goal

In this research, we want to:

1. Find out if the above-said phonological shift in name pronunciation exists on American people.

2. If it does, portrait an outline of how the shifts are like on each culture.

### Method

To achieve the first goal, we will collect a set of phonologically ambiguous  names from cultures across the world, and display them along with faces of random culture.
For each time, only one name and one face is displayed.

We will sample randomly among local American people by asking for participation at different locations across the town.
We will ask them to guess the pronunciation of each name and record their pronunciation for later analysis.
Pronunciations with no face being displayed could work as a control group.

We will build a simple interactive game to help display the names and faces randomly, and also record audios of the pronunciations.

The collected voice clips will go through phonological analysis, from which we could extract key features of each pronunciation.
We will then apply quantitative methods on the extracted features to see if a certain culture is correlated to certain features.
The correlation could be furtherly discussed to answer the question in the second goal.

### Variables and Expectation

The independent variable is the cultures of the faces instead of the names;
and the dependent variable is the phonological features extracted from the voice clips.

It might be surprising that the independent variable is not the names, and the dependent variable is not the phonological shifts (how "off" they are to the correct pronunciation).
This is because we don't actually care about how names are mispronounced, but what we really care is the bias or tendency in phonology when people are facing faces of different cultures.

We expect to see that the cultures do be correlated to phonological features.
